Scenario: Handle Missing Element Gracefully
  Given I am on the missing element page
  When a specific element (e.g., a button or a text) is missing from the page
  Then the page should load without breaking
    And a placeholder or an appropriate message should be displayed

Scenario: Interaction with a Dynamically Loaded Element
  Given I am on the missing element page
  When the element is not initially present
    And the element loads dynamically after some time
  Then I should be able to interact with the element once it appears
    And the page should function as expected without any errors
